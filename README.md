## How I severed the fork to the original repo

I have a bad habit of accidentally raising PRs against originating
repos -- usually I'm just trying to edit my own repo and forget
to check the params in the PR.  [This is how](https://github.com/indieweb/blank-gh-site) I was able to cut
the cord from the original repo used in this website.
